# heart-disease-risk-prediction
Heart disease risk prediction estimates an individual's likelihood of developing heart disease based on factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and lifestyle habits. It uses statistical models, machine learning, or clinical scoring systems (e.g., Framingham Risk Score) to assess risk and guide preventive measures.
